# Getting Started with Create React App

In this project that is my Weather Application I used OpenWeatherMap API that provides Open AI which provides real time weather information.  
Basically it fetch the data from OpenWeatherMap API and then display in the webpage.

Inside this project I also used Material UI which is a Css framework of react and that is having inbuilt components that are written in react. For this first we need to install material UI, import it and then we can use it directly in our project. 
Advantages of this to use is that - we don not need to write CSS.
